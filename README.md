Sunshine
========

This repository is based on the Sunshine app produced by Udacity for the Android Nanodegree course.
It was modified by Edmund Johnson to practice the concepts taught in the course.

The original Udacity README information is as follows:

Sunshine is the companion Android app for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud853).

Take the course to find out how to build this app a step at a time, and eventually create your own Android App!
